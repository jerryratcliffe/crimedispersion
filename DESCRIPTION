Description: When crime changes from one time period to another (such as from year 
    to year), it is sometimes useful to establish how widespread the crime increase covered. 
    Was it across an entire city, or just limited to a few districts or precincts? The answer 
    to this question may help decision-makers determine the extent of any serious crime 
    increases. This package calculates an offense dispersion index that is the ratio of all 
    sub-areas (units) within an overall region that contributed to a crime rate increase.   
    For more information, see Ratcliffe, JH (2010) The spatial dependency of crime increase
    dispersion, Security Journal, 23(1): 18-36.
